# Impact of Fusobacterium nucleatum-Derived Outer Membrane Vesicles on the Intestinal Mucosa

## Overview
This research project explores the role of **Fusobacterium nucleatum** (F. nucleatum) outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in modulating immune responses and potentially impacting colorectal cancer (CRC) development. The study focuses on the internalization of these OMVs by colonic epithelial cells and a comparative analysis with other gram-negative bacterial OMVs.

## Project Goals
- Investigate the mechanisms by which F. nucleatum OMVs interact with and are internalized by colonic epithelial cells.
- Conduct comparative genomic and proteomic analyses to explore potential shared mechanisms with other gram-negative bacteria implicated in CRC.

## Methods
1. **OMV Purification**: OMVs were isolated from three F. nucleatum strains (ATCC 10953, ATCC 25586, ATCC 51191) and characterized using electron microscopy.
2. **Organoid Culture**: Human-derived colonic organoids were used to simulate the intestinal epithelium and study OMV internalization.
3. **Comparative Genomic and Proteomic Analysis**: Bioinformatic tools were employed to analyze outer membrane proteins (OMPs) across several gram-negative bacteria, assessing similarities in adhesion and pathogenicity.

## Results
- **Internalization**: Confocal microscopy confirmed that F. nucleatum OMVs are internalized by colonic epithelial cells.
- **Genomic Insights**: OMVs from F. nucleatum contain adhesion proteins similar to other CRC-associated bacteria, suggesting overlapping mechanisms in CRC progression.

## Future Work
Further studies are recommended to:
- Explore the specific endocytic pathways utilized by F. nucleatum OMVs.
- Investigate the immunogenic properties of OMVs on host epithelial cells.
- Expand the study to other gram-negative bacterial species to better understand common pathways involved in CRC development.
